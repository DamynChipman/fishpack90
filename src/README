#Explanation of src file fish.src:

File names fish.f and fish.F equate under Mac OS X, hence "make clean" removes both. 

We use file fish.src to restore file fish.F whenever gmake is invoked, to insure file fish.F is present.

Add file fish.F.orig to handle the Makefile case for Mac OS X (Darwin). File fish.F.orig
is required since file names fish.f and fish.F equate under Mac OS X, "make clean" removes
both. On systems other than Mac, file fish.f (but not fish.F) is removed.
